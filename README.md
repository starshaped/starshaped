## Hi there 👋

I'm **Aubrey**, pronouns she/her, living on Pocumtuc land in Northampton, Massachusetts. I work at Lullabot as a front-end developer and I love geeking out over CSS and accessibility best practices. I love knitting, tea, and fountain pens, and I'm not a huge fan of pasta, cheese, and balloons. 

### Find me elsewhere!
