## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Aubrey**, she/her, living on Pocumtuc land in Northampton, Massachusetts. I work at Lullabot as a Lead Engineer and I enjoy geeking out over CSS and accessibility best practices. I love knitting, tea, coffee, beer, and fountain pens, and I'm not a huge fan of pasta, cheese, and balloons. 

### Find me elsewhere!
